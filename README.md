# Stamp Album Helper
Made by EatWooloos, maintained by me (jadebage). Periodically updated. The latest version that I have will always be available here.

If there are new stamps I haven't gotten to yet, send in an issue or get in contact with me elsewhere.

# Update (05/25/2025)

I've been using the [itemdb script](https://itemdb.com.br/articles/userscripts) and haven't been maintaining this simply because it's not on my mind. If I'm behind, again, feel free to either send in an Issue or sumbit a Pull Request.
